    "This example shows why it’s important to use mktime() with local time, rather than UTC:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - gmtime() with no argument returns a struct_time using UTC. current_utc shows March 1, 2019 14:51:19 UTC. This is accurate because CST is UTC-06:00, so UTC should be 6 hours ahead of local time.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - mktime() tries to return the number of seconds, expecting local time, but you passed current_utc instead. So, instead of understanding that current_utc is UTC time, it assumes you meant March 1, 2019 14:51:19 CST.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - gmtime() is then used to convert those seconds back into UTC, which results in an inconsistency. The time is now March 1, 2019 20:51:19 UTC. The reason for this discrepancy is the fact that mktime() expected local time. So, the conversion back to UTC adds another 6 hours to local time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Working with time zones is notoriously difficult, so it’s important to set yourself up for success by understanding the differences between UTC and local time and the Python time functions that deal with each."
